# Time-Class
A Python class I wrote called Time(). It's much easier to use than datetime and only takes into account minutes and hours. It also allows you to add and subtract different timestamps to get different results.

Some uses:
- Find the time difference between 2 different times in the day
- Equate minutes to hours
- Represent specific objects of time in hours and minutes only
